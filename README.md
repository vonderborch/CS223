# CS223
Assignments and Projects for CS223 (Advanced Data Structures C/C++) at WSU, taught by Ananth Kalyanaraman in Fall 2012.

This repository contains all my code and miscellaneous files for the class that I could find. There is no guarentee on any of it working perfectly.

NOTE: all of these programs are command-line based (unless otherwise noted) and programmed in C and/or C++ on Windows-platforms (although they should compile under other operating systems).

Folders
- PP1: A program that identifies the pros and cons of linked-lists versus arrays by implementing the Josepus game using both systems and comparing run-time results.
- PP2: A program that compares runtime speed differences between four different algorithms (from pages 52-58 of the textbook 'Data structures and algorithm analysis in C++' by Mark Weiss) for solving the maximum subsequence sum problem.
- PP3: Implements a simple boardgame using STL:set and tests the efficiency of the implementation.
- PP4: Implements a scheduler system for tasks using a priority queue.
